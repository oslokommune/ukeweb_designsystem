      <p>If you to use Vue components or do not want to use pre-compiled CSS files in your project you can bundle and build Oslo style guide yourself for more fine grained control.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Install</strong><br />Add Oslo style guide to your project using for example npm: <code class="osg-code">npm install git://github.com/oslokommune/styleguide.git#1.0</code><br />Tune versioning according to <a href="https://semver.org" target="_blank">semver.org</a>.<br />Available versions can be found at
        <a href="https://github.com/oslokommune/styleguide/releases" target="_blank">https://github.com/oslokommune/styleguide/releases</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Build</strong><br />Set up a build process using a build tool like webpack or parcel. It needs to support the sass-dart compiler and you need to handle font and svg files. Optionally vue and js depending on your needs. It is recommended to use <code class="osg-code">src/osg.scss</code> or either of the index files located in <code class="osg-code">src/packages</code> as entry
        point. You can of course combine a package of your own, but it requires a deeper understanding of how Oslo style guide is put together.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Other libraries</strong><br />
        Oslo style guide is namespaced and should run alongside other namespaced libraries. However, it relies on a specific version of minireset to ensure correct behavior and sets a few global styles depending on which files you include. If other libraries set competing global styles you may end up with varying results.

        <p>Contributions to Oslo style guide should be fun and painless. However, an understanding of how it's built and what rules to follow is needed to maintain a high quality product.</p>
        <h3>Concepts</h3>
        <p>Oslo style guide is built and maintained to provide a set of styles and components commonly used in oslo.kommune.no and related projects. It is not meant to solve all digital use-cases in Oslo kommune.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Should "this" be in Oslo style guide?</strong><br />
          If "this" qualifies as a component, is approved by a maintaining designer of Oslo style guide and is common enough for use in multiple projects the answer is yes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How do we define a component?</strong><br />
          A component is a selection of other components, html elements and/or styles put together following a specific set of rules as a group. Each component is <strong>independent</strong> and must not inherit from other components. However, they may use common styles provided by Oslo style guide.
        </p>
        <h3>Technical</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Understanding Oslo style guide repositories</strong><br />
          Oslo style guide consists of two repositories. The <code class="osg-code">styleguide</code> repository, which follows <a href="https://semver.org" target="_blank">semver.org</a>, and the <code class="osg-code">styleguide_devtools</code> repository. Each major version of the latter will work against the corresponding major version of the former.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>styleguide</strong>
          <br />
          The <code class="osg-code">styleguide</code> repository consists of raw files. Fonts, icons, css, js, vue, html and json. This is what is "consumed" by projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The framework has a rather simple structure.<br />
          <strong>assets</strong> hold fonts, icons and images<br />
          <strong>common</strong> consists of global styles like reset, font, icons and body<br />
          <strong>components</strong> has all of the components<br />
          <strong>general</strong> generates css classes and its documentation which can be used directly in html<br />
          <strong>getting_started</strong> documents how to consume and how to contribute<br />
          <strong>packages</strong> contains combinations of style guide which lets you consume it in different ways<br />
          <strong>pages</strong> hold examples of how a selection of components can make a page<br />
          <strong>system</strong> hold the core of the scss framework. It does not generate css by itself but is rather consumed by components which in turn generate css<br />
          <strong>utils</strong> hold helper scripts for mundane tasks<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>styleguide_devtools</strong>
          <br />
          The <code class="osg-code">styleguide_devtools</code> repository consumes the styleguide repository (just like any project would) and is the very application you now use to browse and contribute to the styleguide repository.<br /><br />Write code in <code class="osg-code">styleguide</code>. View and verify in <code class="osg-code">styleguide_devtools</code>.
        </p>
        <h4>Developing</h4>
        <p>First and foremost, study the examples provided in "Contribute". Both visually and code. They are created to provide a reference for best practice and is what your code will be checked against in code reviews.</p>

        <h5>Styling</h5>
        <p>The stylguide adheres to CSS 3, and uses SCSS for structure. Do not use SASS.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Spacing</strong><br />
          A root element in a component should never have margin. Spacing between components must be applied in projects / contexts or it will decrease the reusability of the component.<br />
          Use the predefined spacing values.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Font size</strong><br />
          Avoid setting font size on inline components as they will normally get their size from the context of which they are used in. Typical inline components are links and icons.<br />
          Use the predefined font sizes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Scaling</strong><br />
          Make sure to use proper <strong>rem</strong> and <strong>em</strong> values. Avoid fixed size elements. You should be able to increase the font size in your browser (not zoom!) without breaking anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>BEM</strong><br />
          Make sure to follow the <a href="https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/" target="_blank">BEM naming convention</a> for (S)CSS.<br />

          Content of a component should always be "BEMified" if the content is required. Optional content must not be "BEMified". Content means text, headings and/or images. An exception to this rule is the grid system, if the grid system is used in a component, do not "BEMify" it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Use of @extend / @use</strong><br />
          You must @extend or @use from <code>system</code> if values are available there.
        </p>
        <h5>General rules</h5>
        <p>
          <strong>Formats</strong><br />
          The following formats are supported.<br />
          <strong>html</strong> for the component code<br />
          <strong>js</strong> for the component javascript<br />
          <strong>vue</strong> for the component vue code<br />
          <strong>scss</strong> for the component styling<br />
          <strong>json</strong> for the component configuration in devtools
        </p>

        <p>Make sure to add javascript and scss files to the corresponding _index files in the root folders or they won't be included.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Things with special meaning</strong><br />
          <code class="osg-code">styleguide_devtools</code> will interpret the following cases in <code class="osg-code">styleguide</code>:<br />
          <strong>_</strong> in folder names will end up as a space when viewed in devtools<br />
          <strong>osg-devtools-code</strong> applied as a class to an html element will make the innerHTML of the element visible in a "View code" box. Adding a child element with the class <code class="osg-code">osg-devtools-code__box</code> will instead only show the innerHTML of this element in "View code." Giving more options in terms of layout. This class also supports colors by adding a
          modifier class <code class="osg-code">osg-devtools-code__box--{palette color}</code>. A child element of the <code class="osg-code">osg-devtools-code__box</code> with the class <code class="osg-code">osg-devtools-code__box__code</code> will only show the innerHTML of this element in the "View code" box, further enhancing the ability to customize the layout of the component and code
          examples.<br />
          <strong>osg-devtools-devmode</strong> applied as a class to an html element will make the child elements only visible on the "Developer" tab<br />
          <strong>osg-devtools-nondevmode</strong> applied as a class to an html element will make the child elements only visible on the "Overview" tab<br />
          <strong>osg-devtools-heading</strong> applied as a class to a heading element followed by a paragraph will create the desired spacing for the "Overview" tab.
        </p>
        <h4>Accessibility</h4>
        <p>All components are WCAG 2.1 AA compliant and follow the guidelines from <a href="https://www.uutilsynet.no/fremtidig-regelverk/wcag-21-standarden/140">Digdir</a>.</p>
        <p>All compontents are tested as individal patterns, but when you use one component you must test the whole page to ensure the component is accessible when interacting with other elements of the page.</p>
        <h5>Checklist for development</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Keyboard navigation with visual focus and correct order.</li>
          <li>Use alternative text in images and an empty one when the image is not relevant.</li>
          <li>Correct use of labels, for example use aria-label when it is not visible.</li>
          <li>Group form elements when necessary with <code>&lt;leyend&gt;</code></li>
          <li>Subtitles in videos.</li>
          <li>Check color contrast.</li>
          <li>Ensure role, value and name to all elements so they are understand by the assistive technology.</li>
          <li>Define a language, for example <code>&lt;html lang="en"&gt;</code></li>
          <li>Use semantic structure and heading.</li>
          <li>Use skip link and landmarks.</li>
        </ul>
